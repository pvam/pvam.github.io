Welcome, 

Currently, I am a M.E Student in <a href="www.csa.iisc.ernet.in">Compute Science</a>  at <a href="www.iisc.ernet.in">Indian Institute of Science</a>. My advisor is <a href="http://dsl.serc.iisc.ernet.in/~haritsa/">Prof. Jayant R. Haritsa</a> and i am a member of <a href="http://dsl.serc.iisc.ernet.in/">Database systems lab</a>.

<br>

I find traditional education boring and always try to pursue it in my own unconventional way. I liked computer science very much( may be because i did not explore other options too much! ) and ended up here :-). Apart from academics, i like Nature and Sports very much though i am no great player in anything.
