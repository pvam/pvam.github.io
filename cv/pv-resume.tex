\section{\sc Experience}
{\bf Technical Project Leader, Huawei India}
\hfill {\bf  July 2016- present  }\\
Design and develop a monitoring solution for one of the in-house Massively Parallel Processing Database. \\
{\bf Teaching Assistant, Database Management System, CSA}
\hfill {\bf  Aug-Dec 2015 }
\section{\sc Selected Projects}
{\bf Predicting Query Execution Time using Statistical Techniques}
\hfill {\bf June 2015  - June 2016}\\
PostgreSQL query optimizer cost model is insufficient for accurately predicting execution time. In this work, we explored the use of machine learning techniques to predict the cost of a given query plan. Complete details including the code and experimental results are available in \underline{\href{http://pvam.github.io/thesis}{this}} github repo.

{\bf Finding similarity across relations using Support estimation}
\hfill {\bf January-May 2015}\\
Developed a sampling based estimation algorithm to find the similarity across relations. Goal is to find the similarity by looking at a fraction of data at both source and/or target and come up with relevant attributes to estimate similarity. 

{\bf Enhancing NECTAR}
\hfill {\bf  January-May 2015}\\
NECTAR(Nash Equilibria CompuTAtion Resource) is a software tool for computing Nash equilibria of strategic form games and extensive form games. As part of the project, we integrated an open source linear programming solver ``lpsolve" into the package and also made it web-accessible.

{\bf Analytics on Encrypted Database}
\hfill {\bf  August-December 2014}\\
Developed techniques to perform Nearest Neighbour Queries on 2-dimensional encrypted data. The solution deals with partitioning encrypted  data into Voronoi cells to have minimal data transfer over network. We have also proposed an extension to deal with higher dimensional data.

{\bf Wordtrix}
\hfill {\bf  [B.E project] August 2013-June 2014}\\
Built an on-line multi-player game based on Boggle (An old word puzzle). As part of this, we developed algorithms to generate games which have sufficient score, protocols to ensure accurate timing and to maintain the user's progress. 

{\bf Free SMS}
\hfill {\bf  [Hobby project] August 2011-December 2013}\\
Built a mobile app which aggregates several free on-line SMS portals each having certain restrictions. As the Services are unreliable, app automatically picks the best service among all feasible services. Got \textbf{1 Million} downloads in windows phone app store alone!
