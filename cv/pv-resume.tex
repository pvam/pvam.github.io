\section{\sc Selected Projects}
{\bf Towards predicting Query Execution Time}
\hfill {\bf [M.E Project] June 2015  - }\\
Query optimizer's cost model are insufficient for accurately predicting execution time. The goal is to come up with relevant metrics to capture CPU and I/O time for different query operators with a trade-off between accuracy and running time. 

{\bf Finding similarity across relations using Support estimation}
\hfill {\bf January-May 2015}\\
Developed a sampling based estimation algorithm to find the similarity across relations. Goal is to get the similarity by looking at fraction of data at both source and target and come up with relevant attributes to estimate similarity. 

{\bf Enhancing NECTAR}
\hfill {\bf  January-May 2015}\\
NECTAR(Nash Equilibria CompuTAtion Resource) is a software tool for computing Nash equilibria of strategic form games and extensive form games. As part of the project, we integrated an open source linear programming solver "lpsolve" into the package and also made it web-accessible.

{\bf Analytics on Encrypted Database}
\hfill {\bf  August-December 2014}\\
Developed techniques to perform Nearest neighbor queries on 2-Dimensional encrypted data. The solution deals with partitioning encrypted  data into Voronoi cells to have minimal data transfer over network. We have also proposed extension for dealing with higher dimensional data.

{\bf Wordtrix}
\hfill {\bf  [B.E project] August 2013-June 2014}\\
Built an on-line multi-player game based on Boggle(An old word puzzle). As part of this, we developed algorithms to generate games which have sufficient score, protocols to ensure accurate timing and to maintain the users progress. 

{\bf Free SMS}
\hfill {\bf  [Hobby project] August 2011-December 2013}\\
Built a mobile app which aggregates several free on-line SMS portals each having certain restrictions. As the Services are unreliable, app automatically picks the best service among all feasible services. Got ~1 Million downloads in windows phone store alone.
